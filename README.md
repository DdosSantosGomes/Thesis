# Thesis
This is the implementation of a Social Network Model created to research the development of polarization in relation with homophily and influential nodes. 
The agents alternately recreate friendship and acquaintanceship relations, and influence each other’s opinions. The NetLogo implementation is not supported by NetLogo Web 
and should therefore be run in the NetLogo application (version 6.2.0). A detailed description of the model, its logical implications, and the results of a number of 
simulations is provided in my bachelor’s thesis, which is included in the repository. Consult the "Info" tab of the NetLogo implementation for practical information
concerning the model.
